Sure, here is a poem about nature:

The beauty of nature
Is a sight to behold,
From the mountains to the sea,
It's all so very bold.

The trees and the flowers,
The birds and the bees,
They all work together
In perfect harmony.

The sun and the rain,
The snow and the wind,
They all play their part
In the circle of life.

Nature is a gift,
One that we should cherish,
Let's do our part to protect it,
For future generations to enjoy.
